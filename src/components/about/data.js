  { tag: 'p', text: 'We offer small group, fun, friendly tours that combine experiencing our beautiful outdoors, meeting some locals, and going off the beaten track to see and experience something a little bit different. Let us guide you along rural walks, have unique ‘invited’ access to an historic private home, and take you to some out of the way places that offer a special experience. While we are always sharing local knowledge of our history, heritage, nature, and storytelling on the way.' },
  { tag: 'p', text: 'I love the outdoors and hiking and am interested in local and family history. Especially so, because I have many direct ancestral family connections in the many industries that have shaped Belfast.' },
  { tag: 'h4', text: 'My 3 core values for Tour Guiding are Passion, Communication and Quirky.' },
  { tag: 'p', text: 'I want to share my Passion for the outdoors and experiencing living history.' },

  { tag: 'p', text: 'And the Quirky – is because of the type of the character I am! Quirky is different, and I do not want these days to feel like ‘stuffy’ historic cultural tours. I am a fun, energetic, sociable character, so I wish my tours to reflect this.' },

  { tag: 'p', text: 'We also offer a day out into County Armagh, exploring the historic City of Armagh, with a choice of some special experiences, including a visit, with lunch and a tour of a fabulous private home and estate of one of the first famous Brambley Apple producers in the county.' },
