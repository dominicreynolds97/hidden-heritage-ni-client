    question: 'What is the cancellation policy?',
    answer: `Depends on the tour. If you cancel a walking tour with 24 hour notice a full refund is given. If we cancel a walking tour due to ‘horrific’ weather conditions or unforeseen circumstances, a full refund will be available. Bespoke tours will have ’non-refundable’ arrangement fees, due to pre-booking access to special locations, but all the costs of the actual day will be fully refunded.`
